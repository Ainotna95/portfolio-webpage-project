        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi! I'm Antonia and I am a Full-Stack Developer. I learnt how to code while studying a Coding Bootcamp with IT Career Switch. I really enjoyed the course, especially as someone who has a background in languages. To me, it is like learning a new way of communicating, except with computers rather than people! I also like the problem-solving aspect of coding. There is nothing more satisfying than resolving a bug or learning a new trick. Thanks for visiting my page and in case you would like to get in touch, head over to the Contact page.</p>
